# Sales Dashboard in Tableau

This dashboard provides an overview of the sales performance of a company. It includes visualizations of sales revenue, profit, and trends over time.

## Getting Started

To use this dashboard, you will need to have Tableau Desktop installed on your computer. You can download a free trial version from the Tableau website.

Once you have Tableau installed, you can open the dashboard file (.twb) and connect it to your data source. The dashboard is pre-populated with sample data, but you can replace it with your own data to customize the dashboard to your needs.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of several visualizations that provide insights into the sales performance of the company. The main visualizations are:

- Sales Revenue by Product Category: A bar chart that shows the total sales revenue for each product category.
- Sales Profit by Region: A map that shows the total profit for each region.

In addition to these main visualizations, there are several other visualizations that provide more detailed information about the sales performance of the company.

## Customization

You can customize this dashboard to fit your specific needs by replacing the sample data with your own data. You can also modify the visualizations to display the information that is most relevant to your business.
